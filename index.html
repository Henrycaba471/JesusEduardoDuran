                    first dish to taste in China”, Beijing Roast Duck used to be a royal
                    dish in medieval China. It has been a “national dish of diplomacy”
                    since the 1970s, when it was first used for the reception of foreign
                    guests by Premier Zhou Enlai (the first Premier of the People's
                    Republic of China). It is highly praised by heads of state,
                    government officials, and domestic and foreign tourists.

                    the middle of the dining table with foodstuffs and condiments around
                    the pot. People can add and cook whatever they like in the broth.
                    The secret of whether a hot pot is good or not lies in the broth,
                    which all the meat slices and vegetables take their flavor from.
                    Chinese people are very fond of hot pot. In the past hot pot used to
                    be favored only in winter, but nowadays hot pot has been appearing
                    on tables all year round. It is a great way to socialize with
                    friends and relatives. People gather around the pot to eat while
                    chatting, eating, drinking, and having fun.
